## Problem Statement

 Retail managers currently lack a centralized, real-time view of sales performance across diverse geographic regions in India. Without clear visibility into Top 5 and Bottom 5 products by both revenue and quantity, the business struggles to optimize inventory levels, leading to stockouts of high-demand items like the Apple iPhone 14 and capital being tied up in low-performing products like Colgate Toothpaste.
 
 The company executes multiple promotional campaigns (e.g., Weekend Flash, Summer Sale, Festive Diwali), but there is no clear data on whether these discounts are translating into significant net sales or merely eroding profit margins. By analyzing the Average Discount by Promotion Category alongside a Profit vs. Net Sales correlation, the business needs to identify which promotions are truly effective and which are underperforming.
 
Fluctuating sales trends and seasonal demand make it difficult for stakeholders to forecast revenue and plan logistics. Current reporting methods are static and do not allow for period-over-period comparisons of Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold. This dashboard aims to solve this by providing interactive filtering and trend analysis to identify growth patterns from 2020 to 2024.

​Geographic Insights: Identify high-performing cities (like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore) to focus marketing efforts.

​Product Rationalization: Pinpoint the "Bottom 5" products to decide on potential discontinuation or rebranding.

​Correlation Analysis: Use the Scatter Plot (Profit vs. Net Sales) to detect outliers where high sales are not yielding expected profits.
